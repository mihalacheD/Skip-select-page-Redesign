Skip Select Page Redesign

This project is a redesign of the skip selection page for WeWantWaste. The goal was to improve UI/UX, responsiveness, and maintain functionality while enhancing the user experience.

Features and Improvements

    The entire page is fully responsive and works across all device sizes.

    Selection Highlighting: When a skip is selected, it is highlighted with a blue background to improve visibility.

    Enhanced Footer Information: The footer now clearly displays: Yard size, Price, 7-day hire duration

    Skeleton Loading States: Implemented card skeleton loaders for a smoother user experience while data is being fetched.

    Button Interaction Effects: Added a press effect when users click buttons for better feedback.

    Improved Typography: Increased font size for better readability and usability.

    Fixed Navbar Scroll on Small Screens: The navbar now supports horizontal scrolling on smaller screens for better navigation.

    Total Cost Calculation Function: Implemented a function to calculate the total cost per week. However, there are minor differences from the original siteâ€™s calculations.
